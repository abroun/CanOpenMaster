Getting CANUSB to work
=======================

In order to be able to use the CANUSB driver without running as root you need to copy udev/01-ftdi.rules to your /etc/udev/rules.d directory.

This will enable ACL (Access Control Lists) for the device which in some way allows a non-root user to use the device
